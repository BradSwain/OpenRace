# Contribution Guide

We welcome any and all contributions (bug fixes, features, documentation, tests, etc.).

For non-trivial additions we recommend opening an issue to discuss the change with the team first. For everything else feel free to open a PR directly.

## Process

1. **Search**  
Search the [issues page](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/issues?q=) for key words related to the change you want to make. Check to see if there has been any previous discussion or work done.

2. **Discuss** (optional for trivial changes)  
Open an issue to discuss non-trivial changes with the team, or to ask for guidance on how to add a feature.

3. **Make a Pull Request**  
Implement the changes and make a pull request. See the "Pull Request Merge Requirements" section below.

4. **Respond to Review**  
A reviewer from our team will look over the code and may have questions or give feedback before merging.

## Pull Request Merge Requirements
If you are unsure about anything, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request anyway. We are happy to help get any contributions merged!

Before a PR is merged it must meet the following requirements:

- Pass all tests
- Add tests covering new functionality
- Follow clang format style guides
- Be approved by relevant code owner

See the developer docs about running and adding tests.

Run clang-format using the `.clang-format` file in the root directory. Most IDE's can be configured to do this automatically.

After opening the PR we will assign the correct reviewer to review the change.

## Developer Workflow

We are tracking what needs to be worked on via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/issues) and we are tracking what is actively being developed on the [dev board](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/projects/1).

If you want to contribute but aren't sure how, look for unassigned issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee) or for un-started issues on the [dev board](https://github.com/coderrect-inc/OpenRace/projects/1).

If you find an issue that look interesting feel free to leave a comment to prevent duplicate efforts, or a comment asking for guidance about how to get started.
